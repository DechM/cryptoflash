### Publishing Workflow
1. Draft article in Notion/Docs → review → export to Markdown/JS structure used in `app/blog/posts.ts`.
2. Add relevant images/screenshots (`public/blog/...`), optimize for web.
3. Update `app/blog/posts.ts` with new entry (title, slug, description, sections, key takeaways).
4. After publishing, share on X, Bluesky, Farcaster, Telegram – link back to blog.
5. Update related/CTA blocks if new articles are the strongest relevant resource.
