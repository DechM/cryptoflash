```
Subject: Exclusive data: $20K+ crypto whale activity in Q4

Hi {{FirstName}},

CryptoFlash monitors cross-chain whale transactions across Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Optimism and Avalanche. For Q4 we observed:

- ${{figure}} inflows into memecoins on Base (up {{percent}}% vs Q3)
- {{count}} “King of the Hill” tokens that unlocked within 24h of whale accumulation
- Example: {{token}} saw {{usd}} in buys from {{wallet count}} wallets before listing

We’re happy to share the full dataset (Bitquery + CoinGecko) along with visualisations, provided we can be cited as the source. Would you be interested in an embargoed preview or collaborative article?

Best,
{{YourName}}
CryptoFlash – KOTH & Whale Intelligence
```

Customize the template with latest metrics before every outreach wave.

### 3. Collaborative Content Ideas

- **Partner spotlight series** – Interview teams who rely on Whale Alerts (e.g. trading desks, DAO treasuries). Publish on CryptoFlash blog, cross-post on partner sites.
- **Data viz threads** – Weekly Twitter thread with top 5 largest transfers, linking back to `/whale-alerts`.
- **Community AMAs** – Host Discord/Twitter Spaces with Bitquery or CoinGecko to discuss whale trends; repurpose the transcript into blog content.

### 4. Growth Loops

1. **Newsletter – “CryptoFlash Weekly Whale Digest”**
   - Every Monday: recap biggest whale transfers, top KOTH candidates and performance of prior alerts.
   - CTA: “Unlock live alerts on Discord” → `/premium`.
   - Collect emails via `/whale-alerts` and blog CTAs.

2. **Free Widget / Embed**
   - Lightweight widget showing the top 3 whale events (24h) with link to CryptoFlash.
   - Offer embed code to partner communities (Step Finance dashboards, trading Discords).

3. **Twitter automation**
   - Continue dynamic hook rotation.
   - Add weekly recap thread (Friday) summarizing whale flow + trending tokens, linking to blog posts.

4. **Build-in-public updates**
   - Bi-weekly Indie Hackers post and LinkedIn update about feature releases, referencing docs/runbooks.
   - Include screenshot of monitoring dashboard + alert samples.

### 5. Success Metrics

- Backlinks acquired (target: 5 Tier A/B links in 60 days).
- Newsletter subscribers (target: 1,000 by end of Q1 2026).
- Social growth: Twitter followers (target +30% per quarter).
- Referral traffic share (Google Analytics → Acquisition > Referrals).

Monitor these monthly and adjust outreach volume accordingly.***
